# Core Features

**AI Model as NFT:**

Arka Network offers AI developers a unique platform to showcase and monetize their models. Instead of just displaying their work, developers can transform their models into NFTs, unlocking options such as leasing and licensing. Additionally, fractional ownership of these model NFTs can be offered, allowing developers to draw in investors and generate funds. This ensures they tap into all possible sources of revenue and receive the recognition they deserve.

**NFT Licensing:**

A standout feature setting Arka Network apart is its innovative take on NFT licensing. We're gearing up to support a wide spectrum of digital assets, prominently including copyrighted content such as AI models and the unique content they generate. Through our platform, creators will have the capability to issue multiple blockchain-verified licenses or copies of their digital assets. These licensed copies can serve a multitude of purposes for the licensee, whether they're using AI-generated avatars, immersive background tunes, or any other form of digital artistry. Yet, we're also adamant about preserving creators' rights. These licensed copies are designed with restrictions to prevent unauthorized redistribution or resale, acting as a wall against copyright infringement. Licensing, in this manner, doesn't just diversify the applications of an NFT; it also carves out consistent revenue channels for NFT holders.

**NFT Leasing:**

Building on the growing trend of NFT renting, Arka Network elevates the concept. NFT owners can lease out their assets to gamers or web3 users for durations that can vary from a few minutes to several months. Throughout this lease, the lessee commits to regular payments, which benefit both the NFT owner and the initial creator, depending on the royalty setup of the NFT. This innovation introduces a consistent and dynamic source of income to the NFT world.

**Creators' Toolbox:**

Arka Network provides content creators with a comprehensive suite of tools to maximize their creativity:

_Vast AI Model Selection:_ Creators can tap into an extensive collection of AI models, allowing them to produce creative content both efficiently and affordably.

_Prompt Tools:_ Creators are offered tools to generate multiple variations of prompts, enhancing the diversity of the content output.

_Integration with Advanced AI Tools:_ Seamless integration with tools like ChatGPT ensures an intuitive way for creators to instruct AI models.

_Editing Tools:_ After content generation, creators have the capability to make edits based on the type of content, ensuring the final output aligns with their vision.

_Flexible Export Options:_ Once satisfied with the content, creators can export their work in various formats, catering to different distribution needs.

**Launchpad for AI Models**

Arka Network facilitates fractional ownership, allowing multiple stakeholders to hold a part of an AI model NFT, democratizing access and investment. Using this the platform serves as a launchpad for budding AI developers with promising models but limited funds, offering them the resources and exposure they need to flourish.
