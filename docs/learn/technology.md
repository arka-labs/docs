## Leveraging Cosmos SDK
Arka Network's technological foundation is rooted in the Cosmos SDK, a state-of-the-art framework for building interoperable and customizable blockchains. Here's a detailed insight:

Cosmos and Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC):

Cosmos aims to establish an 'Internet of Blockchains', enabling different blockchains to communicate and interact seamlessly. The IBC protocol is central to this vision, allowing the transfer of assets and information between chains. Arka Network taps into IBC to ensure fluid communication with other chains within the Cosmos ecosystem, paving the way for effortless asset and data transfers.


Proof of Stake (PoS):

PoS is a consensus mechanism where validators are chosen based on the amount of tokens they're willing to "stake" as collateral. This approach not only promotes energy efficiency but also scalability. Arka Network utilizes PoS to drive a robust and scalable consensus process, with validators incentivized to maintain network integrity.

Modularity:

The design philosophy of Cosmos SDK supports modularity, enabling developers to craft their blockchains using both pre-built and custom modules. Arka Network leverages this feature to customize its blockchain, aligning with the network's unique goals and requirements.

Validators and Relayers:

In the PoS system of Cosmos, validators are pivotal for block production and transaction confirmation. Meanwhile, relayers play an essential role in the IBC protocol by transferring messages between chains. Arka Network's ecosystem thrives on a trusted network of validators ensuring transaction and network security, while relayers are instrumental in upholding our commitment to inter-chain connectivity.

CosmWasm:

CosmWasm introduces a smart contracting layer to the Cosmos SDK through WebAssembly (Wasm), enabling developers to script smart contracts in languages like Rust and Go. By incorporating CosmWasm, Arka Network offers a versatile platform for smart contract deployment, broadening the horizons for developers and users alike.


By integrating the functionalities of the Cosmos SDK, Arka Network stands at the forefront of blockchain innovation, supporting a decentralized ecosystem that's both adaptive and interconnected.


## Royalties Module
Royalties form the crux of ensuring creators are continuously rewarded for their ingenuity. While the concept of royalties isn't new, Arka Network believes in innovating and refining this system, especially in the ever-evolving NFT space.

Note: Arka is committed to building the underlying technology to effectively implement the following two royalty models, ensuring they operate seamlessly within the ecosystem.

Type of Royalties on Arka:

Fixed:

In the traditional model, a fixed percentage of royalties is applied to every subsequent sale or transaction of the NFT, remaining unchanged throughout its lifecycle. This provides creators with predictability, ensuring a continuous stream of income regardless of the NFT's sales frequency. For Arka Network, this model is ideal for those creators seeking consistency in their revenue streams.


Time Decay:

The royalty percentage diminishes over time, possibly adhering to a predetermined schedule or specific milestones. As the NFT ages, the royalty charged on its transactions dwindles. Arka Network introduces this system to address the potential decrease in an NFT's value or relevance over time. By tapering off royalties with the passage of time, it not only incentivizes traders and secondary owners to invest in older NFTs but also ensures that creators are adequately compensated during the NFT's peak periods.


Sales Decay:

Royalties are contingent on the frequency of the NFT's sales, meaning the initial sales might incur a higher royalty, which subsequently reduces. This model is integral to Arka Network's approach, recognizing the substantial value that original creators contribute by debuting a unique NFT. Although they receive significant rewards for initial sales, the decreasing royalty structure as the NFT undergoes more transactions promotes liquidity in the marketplace.


## Payment Splitter Contract
In the evolving landscape of NFTs, especially those generated using AI models, the creation process often involves multiple stakeholders. For an NFT birthed from an AI model, there's the model creator who designs and fine-tunes the AI model, and the content creator who uses this model to generate unique content. Both play pivotal roles and bring distinct value to the final NFT product. Hence, it's essential that the royalties garnered from the NFT's sales or leases are equitably divided based on their contributions.

Concept:

A Payment Splitter Contract acts as an automated intermediary ensuring that, upon every transaction or event that generates revenue for an NFT, the proceeds are split and dispatched to the respective parties based on a predetermined agreement. This contract operates on the blockchain, ensuring transparency, immutability, and automatic execution without the need for a third-party arbiter.

Utility in Arka Network:

Arka Network recognizes the collaborative nature of AI-generated NFTs and the necessity to fairly compensate all contributors. By developing a robust Payment Splitter Contract technology, Arka Network aims to:

Automate Payments: Upon every sale, lease, or licensing of the NFT, the contract will automatically calculate and dispatch the agreed-upon percentages to the model creator and content creator.

Ensure Transparency: Being on the blockchain, all transactions are recorded. Both parties can verify the amounts received and ensure they align with the agreed-upon split.

Flexibility: While the contract ensures automation, it also provides flexibility. Parties can set their royalty split ratio during the NFT's creation or initial agreement phase, allowing for diverse collaboration terms.

Trustless Operations: By eliminating the need for intermediaries and manual calculations, the contract fosters a trustless environment. Parties can be confident that they'll receive their dues without discrepancies or delays.

By integrating the Payment Splitter Contract, Arka Network not only champions fairness but also promotes collaboration. Model creators and content creators can engage in joint ventures, confident that the system will equitably distribute the fruits of their labor.


## Decentralized GPU Network Integration
Arka Network's integration of a decentralized GPU network revolutionizes the way computational tasks are executed. Through this distributed system, participants offer their GPU resources, allowing users to access and utilize a collective pool of GPU power seamlessly. This peer-to-peer framework ensures not only optimal resource allocation but also dynamic pricing based on usage. Users pay for the exact GPU resources they consume, while providers are incentivized with compensation for offering their computational power. The decentralized nature reduces single points of failure, and the system's inherent scalability means that as more GPU resources join, the network can handle larger computational loads. Integrated security protocols ensure data processed remains confidential and tamper-proof.


## NFT Leasing and Licensing
Arka Network is in the process of developing new Interchain Standards (ICS) aimed at NFT leasing and licensing. Drawing inspiration from the ERC-5635 standard, Arka's innovative approach promises to bring transparency, consistency, and clarity to the world of NFT licensing, especially in relation to derivative artworks.

NFT Leasing

NFT leasing enables AI model developers and content owners to lease their NFTs, generating a steady source of passive income. For instance, an AI developer can lease out their model, allowing the lessee to utilize it for their business or create additional revenue streams based on the AI model's capabilities.

Use cases for leasing (for lessees) include:

Building a business around the AI model, similar to applications like FaceApp. Since Arka Network manages scalability and availability, business owners can focus on expanding their ventures without the need to pay royalties or fees to the AI developer for each model usage. 

Enabling business owners without development expertise to issue licenses for AI models they lease. All license fees would accrue to the lessee, while the owner receives the lease amount as compensation.

Empowering music streaming companies to lease generated music and use it to generate revenue on multiple platforms. Content owners benefit from a consistent income stream, while music companies leverage their revenue-generating expertise. This mutually beneficial arrangement benefits both parties.


Lease terms are negotiated and agreed upon by both parties, with the owner's (AI model and content) credibility linked to their track record of past leases. Owners who frequently cancel leases may see their rating decline, ensuring that lessees can select trustworthy owners for their leasing needs.



NFT Licensing:

NFT (Non-Fungible Token) licensing is a relatively new concept within the world of NFTs, and it pertains to how ownership and usage rights of digital assets represented by NFTs are managed and regulated. Here are some key aspects and information about NFT licensing:

Ownership and Rights: When someone purchases an NFT, they acquire ownership of a digital asset, whether it's an image, video, music file, or other digital content. However, owning an NFT doesn't necessarily grant the buyer full rights to use, distribute, or modify the underlying content. NFT licensing addresses the permissions and restrictions associated with NFT ownership.

License Types: NFTs can come with different types of licenses, specifying what the owner is allowed to do with the digital asset. Common types of licenses include:

Copyright License: This license allows the owner to view and enjoy the digital asset but doesn't grant them rights to reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works.

Commercial License: This license permits the owner to use the NFT for commercial purposes, such as selling or licensing the content to others.

Derivative Work License: This allows the owner to create derivative works based on the NFT, which can be crucial in the world of digital art.

Smart Contracts: NFT licensing terms are often encoded in smart contracts associated with the NFT. Smart contracts automatically enforce the agreed-upon rules, ensuring that the owner complies with the terms of the license.

Artist Control: Some NFT platforms enable artists and creators to retain control over their work even after it's sold. For example, they may have the ability to update the content associated with the NFT, or even restrict licensee to use one specific version of the AI model/content.

Legal Considerations: NFT licensing is still an emerging field, and the legal aspects can vary by jurisdiction. The terms and conditions of an NFT license should be carefully considered and legally binding to avoid disputes.

Marketplaces and Standards: NFT marketplaces may implement their own licensing standards, and artists often specify their licensing terms when minting NFTs. Additionally, industry standards and best practices for NFT licensing are continually evolving.

Use Cases: NFT licensing has applications beyond digital art. It can be relevant to music, video, virtual real estate, virtual goods in video games, and more. Each use case may have its own unique licensing considerations.  In summary, NFT licensing is a crucial aspect of the NFT ecosystem that defines what rights and restrictions come with NFT ownership. It's a rapidly evolving field as creators, buyers, and platforms work to establish clear standards and practices for the licensing of digital assets on the blockchain.

Conclusion:

Pioneering the ICS standards, Arka Network's interchain licensing and leasing framework is set to redefine the creation, administration, and trade of NFT derivative pieces. By rendering a transparent and standardized protocol, Arka determines that both licensors and licensees transact their NFT dealings with utmost clarity and assurance.
