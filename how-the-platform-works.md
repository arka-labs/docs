# How the platform works

**AI Model Upload:** Developers start their journey on Arka Network by uploading their AI models.

**Portfolio Creation:** Developers generate distinct outputs using specific prompts for their model. These prompts and their outputs are displayed as a portfolio, giving potential users a glimpse into the model's capabilities**.**

**Model Tokenization as NFTs:** Once the portfolio is set, developers can convert their AI models into NFTs, enhancing their visibility and potential for monetization on the platform.

**Model Creator Monetization:** With their model now tokenized as an NFT, developers have a suite of monetization tools at their disposal. They can opt for direct sales, introduce fractional ownership for fundraising, or explore avenues like leasing and licensing.

**Cost Estimation & Suggested Pricing:** The computational costs associated with generating the sample outputs are averaged out. Using this data, Arka Network suggests a pricing structure for users, ensuring transparency and predictability in model usage costs.

**Community Interaction & Selection:** Users can peruse the showcased portfolios, understanding the potential of each model. They can then select models that resonate with their needs, guided by the sample outputs and pricing recommendations.

**Content Creation & Monetization:** After selecting an AI model, users can generate content. They can then choose to mint this content as an NFT, with the option to trade, lease, or license it for diverse monetization opportunities.

**Validator Election & Execution:** Validators are chosen to handle specific content creation tasks. They assess the task's details and cost estimates before making a decision on its acceptance or rejection.
