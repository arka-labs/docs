# Problem Statement

**AI developers** especially those who are small to medium-scale, struggle with the lack of effective platforms to monetize their models.

Existing platforms often offer limited ways to monetize, further constraining AI developers.

Many AI developers have the technical expertise but lack the funds to develop and train their models effectively.

**Content creators** are keen on using AI tools but are often held back by their high costs.

The existing NFT marketplaces, while promising, have been largely one-dimensional, focusing mainly on traditional trading and neglecting other utilities like leasing or licensing.

Current platforms don't offer easy ways for AI developers and content creators to collaborate.

Centralized platforms often lack transparency, creating trust issues among users.
