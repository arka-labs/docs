# Decentralized GPU Network Integration

Arka Network's integration of a decentralized GPU network revolutionizes the way computational tasks are executed. Through this distributed system, participants offer their GPU resources, allowing users to access and utilize a collective pool of GPU power seamlessly. This peer-to-peer framework ensures not only optimal resource allocation but also dynamic pricing based on usage. Users pay for the exact GPU resources they consume, while providers are incentivized with compensation for offering their computational power. The decentralized nature reduces single points of failure, and the system's inherent scalability means that as more GPU resources join, the network can handle larger computational loads. Integrated security protocols ensure data processed remains confidential and tamper-proof.
